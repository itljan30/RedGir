# RedGir

**RedGir** is a minimalistic game engine designed to abstract away low-level details like OpenGL and OpenAL calls. By focusing on simplicity and efficiency, RedGir enables developers to build games without getting bogged down by the intricacies of graphics, audio, and input management.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Graphics Management:**
  - Abstraction over OpenGL for rendering.
  - Add and manage quads, sprites, and sprite sheets.
  - Support for custom shaders with shader groups.
  - Toggle fullscreen and border options dynamically.
  - Manage window dimensions and properties.

- **Audio Integration:**
  - Abstraction over OpenAL for audio playback and management. *(Planned)*

- **Input Handling:**
  - Keyboard and mouse event polling.
  - Support for customizable input actions and cursor control.

### Customization Options
- Configure window properties:
  - Set window size, border visibility, and resizability.
  - Toggle fullscreen mode and FPS display.
- Manage rendering layers and assign shaders to sprites.
- Set clear colors for background rendering.

### Planned Features
- Additional audio playback capabilities.
- Extended input management with more action mappings.
- More comprehensive shader and rendering tools.

## Engine Structure

### `Engine`
The main entry point for the game engine, responsible for managing:
- **Window Management**: Handles the window and its properties via `WindowManager`.
- **Input Management**: Polls and processes input events using `InputManager`.
- **Audio Management**: Manages audio playback with `AudioManager`.

### `EngineBuilder`
A builder pattern for configuring the engine before initialization. Options include:
- Window properties like size, name, cursor visibility, borders, and resizability.
- Input polling settings for keys, cursor position, mouse buttons, and scroll.

### Examples

#### Initialize the Engine
```rust
let mut engine = Engine::new()
    .set_window_size(1024, 768)
    .set_window_name("My Game")
    .set_clear_color(Color::BLUE)
    .hide_cursor()
    .borderless()
    .poll_keyboard()
    .poll_mouse_buttons()
    .init();
```
